# MovieBee- Angular Client Application

## Objective
The client-side for the MovieBee application using Angular, based on its existing server-side code ([MovieBee-API](https://github.com/smavuleti/MovieBee-API)), with supporting documentation.

---

## Context
This project aims to create a responsive, single-page application for MovieBee using Angular. The application will handle data interaction through pre-defined REST API endpoints, offering a modern, user-friendly interface for managing movie-related information.

### Why Angular?
Angular is a versatile framework suited for large-scale projects and complex user interfaces. Its built-in modules and services make it ideal for building robust and maintainable applications.

## Design Criteria

### User Stories
- **As a user,** I want to receive information on movies, directors, and genres to learn more about movies Iâ€™ve watched or am interested in.
- **As a user,** I want to create a profile to save data about my favorite movies.

### Key Features
1. **Welcome View**  
   - Users can log in or register an account.
2. **Main View**  
   - Displays a list of all movies once authenticated.
3. **Single Movie View**  
   - Shows additional details about a selected movie.
   - Includes:
     - A button to navigate to the director view for details about the movie's director.
     - A button to navigate to the genre view for details about the movie's genre.
